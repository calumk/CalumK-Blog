The ESP8266 is a wonderful cheap wifi module. The arduino is a wonderful cheap
microcontroller. The ESP8266 can act as a "wireless bridge" which in laymans
terms means it can almost pretend to be a USB cable. If the ESP8266 is "port
forwarded" so that it is accessable to the outside world, and connected to an
arduino, then we can use it to program an arduino. [Check it
