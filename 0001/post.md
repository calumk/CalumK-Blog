I just finished my new website and a really snazzy super simple blogging
script...

It Should make it nice and easy for me to format and type blog
posts super quickly! Isnt that fun? Maybe I should put it on GitHub? I need a
slightly lighter font tho.... Oh well, while I deal with that, you look at
this B.E.A.Utiful picture of me :D

###UPDATE:
As of 1st July 2015, I have re-written the blogging engine.
It's cleaner and runs of markdown and json, instead of a *terrible* descicion i made to make it work of line numbers.
